# K-MeansClusteringAlgorithm
This is basic implementation of K-Means Clustering algorithom. K-Means clustering allowed us to approach a domain without really knowing a whole lot about it, and draw conclusions and even design a useful application around it.
The algorithm will categorize the items into k groups of similarity. To calculate that similarity, we will use the euclidean distance as measurement.
