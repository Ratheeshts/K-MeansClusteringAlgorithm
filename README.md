# K-MeansClusteringAlgorithm
This is basic implementation of K-Means Clustering algorithom. K-Means clustering allowed us to approach a domain without really knowing a whole lot about it, and draw conclusions and even design a useful application around it.
The algorithm will categorize the items into k groups of similarity. To calculate that similarity, we will use the euclidean distance as measurement.
The algorithm works as follows:

First we initialize k points, called means, randomly.
We categorize each item to its closest mean and we update the meanâ€™s coordinates, which are the averages of the items categorized in that mean so far.
We repeat the process for a given number of iterations and at the end, we have our clusters.
